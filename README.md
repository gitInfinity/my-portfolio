## Muhammad Rouhan's Portfolio
This is my personal portfolio website, built using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. It dynamically fetches my projects from the GitHub API to showcase my skills and experience as a Flutter Developer and AI/ML Engineer.

(This project was originally adapted from a template by Jigar Sable.)
